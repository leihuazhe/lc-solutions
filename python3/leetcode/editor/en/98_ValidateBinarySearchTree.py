"""
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (
BST). 

 A valid BST is defined as follows: 

 
 The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's 
key. 
 The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the 
node's key. 
 Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. 
 

 
 Example 1: 
 
 
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
 

 Example 2: 
 
 
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
 -2¬≥¬π <= Node.val <= 2¬≥¬π - 1
