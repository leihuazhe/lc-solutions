# [2300]-successful-pairs-of-spells-and-potions

"""
You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m 
respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the i·µó ∞ spell and 
potions[j] represents the strength of the j·µó ∞ potion. 

 You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered 
successful if the product of their strengths is at least success. 

 Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of 
potions that will form a successful pair with the i·µó ∞ spell. 

 
 Example 1: 

 
Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
Output: [4,0,3]
Explanation:
- 0·µó ∞ spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1À¢·µó spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2‚Åø·µà spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16
Output: [2,0,2]
Explanation:
- 0·µó ∞ spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [24,15,24]. 2 pairs are successful.
- 1À¢·µó spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful. 
- 2‚Åø·µà spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [16,10,16]. 2 pairs are successful. 
Thus, [2,0,2] is returned.
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 n == spells.length 
 m == potions.length 
 1 <= n, m <= 10‚Åµ 
 1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 10‚Åµ 
 1 <= success <= 10¬π‚Å∞
