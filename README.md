Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This repository is dedicated to improving my skills in algorithms and data
structures through solving problems on LeetCode.
## Main Objectives üéØ
Learning Algorithms: The primary goal of this repository is to enhance my understanding of various algorithms used in
computer science. By solving LeetCode problems, I aim to grasp different algorithmic techniques and strategies.
Improving Data Structures: Alongside algorithms, I am focused on strengthening my knowledge of data structures. Through
implementing and utilizing various data structures in solving problems, I aim to become proficient in their usage and
understand their performance characteristics.
Deep Diving: Each problem solved here represents an opportunity for a deep dive into its underlying concepts and
approaches. I aim not only to solve the problems but also to understand the rationale behind different solutions, their
time and space complexities, and their applications in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure üìÇ
Algorithms: This directory contains solutions to LeetCode problems categorized by algorithms. Each algorithm has its own
folder containing relevant problems and their solutions.
Data Structures: Similarly, this directory contains implementations of different data structures encountered while
solving LeetCode problems. Each data structure has its own folder with implementations and relevant explanations.
